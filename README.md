## Description

<br>

Crown Clothing is an e-commerce web application similar to Shopify (that you guessed it, is a mock clothing retailer). In addition, it's a full stack (MERN) Progressive Web Application that uses Firebase authentication and handles online payments with the Stripe API. While building this application I furthered my knowledge about React, Redux, Jest testing, and working with the Stripe API while also learning about Google's Firebase, Styled Components, etc. Overall, I had a blast learning about the latest features in React and different state management and I hope you enjoy Crown Clothing as much as I did when building it!
